     <u><h1>The D23 Project, The Inspiration Of <a href="D24.html">D24</a></u></h1>

    <br>
    <p>When The D23 Project Began, A Friend Suggested To Me that I Could Rick-Roll Everyone In a room in Seconds...</p>
    <p>By Using the fact that everyone had to Manually connect their Laptops to the internet at the beginning of every lesson!</p>
    <p>So I got thinking, If I could design a device that could Show the classic "<i>Never gonna give you up</i>" line on the list of Avalible Wifi Networks, Every...Single...Person in the room would be instantly Rickrolled!</p>

      <h3><i>How It Started...</i></h3>
      <p>At The Very beginning of this Mischevious Project, All we had access to was a Lonely Singular Mobile Phone Hotspot, Of course This meant that we could only show one line of the song!</p><p>We Simply Could Not Stand to that level of Boringness!  We Needed exitement and most importantly, A Good Laugh From Anyone in the room!</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <h3>The Development...</h3>
       <p>When DriverJack Started developing this project, He immediatly thought of the ESP32 Wifi Chip. This Chip Just so happened to be able to perform something called a <b>Beacon 'Attack', This type of attack allowed DriverJack to Display all of the Main lyrics of the song!</b></p>
<br>
    <h3>The Start...</h3>
    <p>On The First day of usage: This New Device was brought out on the 21st, May 2023</p><p>We turned on the device or the first time just before everyone brought out their laptops!</p><p>The laughs  got that day will never ever ever be forgotten ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <h3>Shutdown!?</h3>
    <p>A couple days into usage, Some 'people' began to think that it wasnt just a coincidence! They Entered the room and started whispering to each other!  They Had no idea Where the mysterious signals where coming from!!!!! </p> 
    <h3>The End Of D23...</h3>
    <p>Eventually, the idea became a bit boring and we got thirsty for more entertainment, Therefore... <i>More Stuff Is On The Way</i></p>
   <center> <small>This <i>Adventure</i> Caused no problems and was built with no harm in mind whatsoever!</small></center>
